I will create an interactive application using HTML, CSS, SASS, JS and VUE. As well as design and develop an engaging experience for the end user with which they can interact in a one-page web application.

## Installing and running app 

Run the web app after cloning it into any directory with `cd`. You can also download the app by going to the repo, clicking the green button that says "Code," and clicking on "Download ZIP."
